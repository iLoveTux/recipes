Basic Dough
===========

This recipe is what you might consider pizza dough, but it is extremely versitile and can be used
in many different types of recipes. I have a family of 5 and I make a batch every night or two,
divide into thirds and refrigerate in zip-lock sandwich bags for use the next day. It serves us
well.

Ingredients
-----------

* 1.5 cups warm water
* 1.5 tbl active dry yeast
* 3 tbl vegetable oil
* 1 tsp honey
* 4 cups bread flour
* 1 tbl salt
* 1 tbl sugar

__Tip__: I buy bulk sizes and combine pre-measured amounts of flour, salt and sugar into gallon
sized ziplock bags to make it quicker to make a batch of dough.

__Tip__: Get a stand-mixer and treat it well as it will make this process incredibly easy. If you
have a stand-mixer use it on the lowest setting with a dough-hook when the directions say to
kneed the dough.

Directions
----------

1. Combine water, honey, yeast and oil into bowl (or stand-mixer) and mix. Let stand for 5 minutes
until a small froth forms
2. Add flour, salt and sugar to yeast mixture, mix and kneed until uniform and slightly sticky
3. Divide with a knife (or dough-scraper sometimes called a bash-n-chop) I usually divide into
thirds, but it depends on what it will be used for. It is important to divide at this point before
the next step otherwise it will behave strangely.
4. "Ball the dough up" by stretching dough into a ball-shape and pinching the back together.
5. Lightly coat dough-ball with oil and store (I usually store in ziplock bags, but anything
which can be closed will do)

That's it. You now have a nice batch of dough which will enable you to make a ton of different foods
in this cookbook.
